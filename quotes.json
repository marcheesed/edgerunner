    "do you know fullness if you have never starved?",
    "all the words i left unsaid that day stained the sidewalk drop by drop with grey",
    "didn't you see the news today?",
    "if everybody accepts one day that they'll die they'd see the joy in life, and thats the reason we're alive!!!!!",
    "i guess it was just one more way everything got messed up for them.",
    "i would like to think that even if i was sad and scared, if i was put in a position where everyone depended on me, i could put all those feelings aside and do whats right!",
    "there's still something worth fighting for!!!!",
    "we're fragile creatures made of love, we could act impulse when our lives get tough!",
    "now that i've things i hold dear, my fear of death has reappeared!",
    "i know exactly why i walk and talk just like a machine!"
